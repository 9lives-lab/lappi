Lappi is a research project dedicated to help organize and explore a music collection.

## Structure

At the moment the project consists of two modules:
- lappi_lab: Executable application.
- lappi_core: Most of the code is located here. Expected to be included in builds for other platforms (mobile, etc.) in the future.

## Quick start

Lappi Lab is only intended to be launched from IDE.

To launch the application, it is sufficient to set up the workspace and run the standard configuration.

A workspace is a working directory where the application stores launch configuration files, settings, music collection, etc. 
This way, it is possible to have multiple independent workspaces for different work scenarios. 
The working directory is configured by 'LAPPI_WORKSPACE' environment variable.
